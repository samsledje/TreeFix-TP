Source code for the fitch.linux executable which is used to calculate transmission cost at each iteration of TreeFix-VP. This code implements Fitch's algorithm for the small parsimony problem on a given phylogeny. Newick tree reading is done using the newick-tools C library, which is wrapped here. Below is the README for [newick-tools](https://github.com/xflouris/newick-tools).

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to implement a proper, multifunctional newick
manipulation toolkit called `newick-tools`. The toolkit should:

* correctly parse newick files, both binary rooted and binary unrooted.
* parse n-ary newick files and allow collapsing into binary rooted/unrooted.
* parse the [newick extended format](http://dmi.uib.es/~gcardona/BioInfo/enewick.html)
* create new topologies from existing one by pruning taxa, or inducing subtrees.
* generate topologies
* list taxa, or taxa of specific subtrees
* visualize the tree in terminal (ASCII), vector formats such as SVG and EPS, and raster format such as PNG.
* compare topologies
* root trees given outgroup taxon or outgroup subtree
* locate repeated substructures (subtree repeats)
* display tree info (rooting,number of taxa, max branch length, average branch length etc)
* generate a consensus tree from a collection of trees.
* perform all above functions on files that contain more than one tree, e.g. induce the subtrees of specific taxa in a collection of trees.


## Compilation instructions

Currently, `newick-tools` requires that [GNU Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
and [Flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/) are installed on the target system. On
a Debian-based Linux system, the two packages can be installed using the command

`apt-get install flex bison`

`newick-tools` also requires that a GNU system is available as it uses several
functions (e.g. `asprintf`) which are not present in the POSIX standard.
This, however may change in the future such that the code is more portable.

`newick-tools` can be compiled using the included Makefile:

`make`
