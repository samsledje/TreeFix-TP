Source code for the fitch.linux executable which is used to calculate transmission cost at each iteration of TreeFix-VP. This code implements Fitch's algorithm for the small parsimony problem on a given phylogeny. Newick tree reading is done using the [newick-tools](https://github.com/xflouris/newick-tools) C library, which has been modified here. It also uses the [hashmap](http://elliottback.com/wp/hashmap-implementation-in-c/) implemented by Elliot C Back, as well as my own bitset code.
